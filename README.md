A Lightweight Survey Tool for Online Studies is a web, based on web application for online surveys. This is a group project for the university semester application.

## Database: any name { database table names: emails, trials, users }

###### Note: Database name you should put in our project folder / php/ config.php file line number 7.

## Objective:

To develop a user-friendly, efficient, and lightweight survey tool for conducting online studies and collecting data in the fields of research, education, and market analysis. The tool will be built using JavaScript for the front-end, PHP for the back-end, and MySQL for database management.

## Features:
1. User Authentication: Implement a secure user authentication system to allow researchers and participants to register and log in to the platform.

2. Survey Creation: Enable researchers to create custom surveys with various question types, including multiple-choice, open-ended, rating scales, and more.

3. Survey Management: Provide researchers with the ability to manage their surveys, including editing, deleting, and archiving.

4. Participant Recruitment: Allow researchers to invite participants via email or share survey links through various channels.

5. Data Collection: Collect and store survey responses securely in a MySQL database, associating responses with specific surveys and participants.

6. Real-time Analytics: Present researchers with real-time graphical representations and summary statistics of survey results.

7. Export Data: Enable researchers to export survey data in common formats like CSV or Excel for further analysis.

8. Mobile Responsiveness: Design the survey tool to be mobile-friendly, allowing participants to take surveys on various devices.

9. Data Anonymization: Implement data anonymization techniques to ensure participant privacy and data protection.

10. Multi-language Support: Offer support for multiple languages to accommodate international users and participants.

## Tech Stack:
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery, Vue.js, or React)
- Back-end: PHP (with a framework like Laravel or CodeIgniter)
- Database: MySQL
- Server: Apache or Nginx

## Development Stages:
1. Project Planning: Define requirements, create wireframes, and develop a project timeline.
2. Database Design: Design the database schema to efficiently store survey data.
3. Front-end Development: Build the user interface for survey creation, participant registration, and survey-taking.
4. Back-end Development: Develop the PHP-based server-side logic to handle user authentication, survey management, and data storage.
5. Integration: Integrate the front-end and back-end components to create a seamless user experience.
6. Testing: Thoroughly test the application for functionality, performance, and security.
7. Deployment: Deploy the survey tool on a web server with the necessary configurations.
8. Maintenance: Provide ongoing support and updates to ensure the tool's reliability and security.

Note: Ensure to comply with data protection laws and regulations, especially when dealing with sensitive participant information.

With this project, researchers can easily create, manage, and analyze surveys, while participants can conveniently take surveys online, leading to streamlined data collection for a wide range of research and analysis purposes.
